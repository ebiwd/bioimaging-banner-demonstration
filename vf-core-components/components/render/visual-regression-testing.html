title: Visual Regression Testing
order: 105

To be confident that we can ammend components code if needed without breaking anything we need to test against the agreed look and interaction(s) of a component.



We are making use of [BackStopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) to do this. We store the reference 'truth' on github inside the component library monorepo [vf-core](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core). We run this locally on our machines before pushing to the remomte repository to create a PR.



## To get this working:



First, make sure you have the latest `develop` branch and have `npm install`ed so everything is in place. When you get to a point in your code where you want to create a PR you will need to test your changes against the Visual Regressiong Testing (VRT) reference images.


## To do this:


1. Run `gulp frctlVRT` to create an updated static build of the component library.
2. Run `gulp vizres-test` to start the test.

When the test is complete it will open your default browser and display the results.

It currently fails comparisons that have a 1.0% or more difference.
